# SpotMicroQuadruped
This repository is for my creation of an open source quadruped.
This repository contains software I am editing to fit my robot
from multiple sources. 

The first is the Stanford Pupper Quadruped.
The original code can be found here: https://github.com/stanfordroboticsclub/StanfordQuadruped.git
My code contains edited versions of this and their unedited lisence.

In edition, I am also using software from the Spot Micro AI project
which is the main inspiration for this build (Hence the name).
I am using code from Github user adham-elarabawy
his original code can be found here: https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/OpenQuadruped
My code contains edited versions of this and his unedited lisence.
